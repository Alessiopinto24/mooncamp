### Activité 2: 

Human exploration of the Moon requires resources: water, oxygen, food, materials, propellant, etc. Bringing everything from Earth would be very inefficient and expensive, so instead mission designers are investigating how to use resources already available on the Moon. One of the most important resources is water. Scientists found evidence that water may exist in some areas towards the Moon's poles. On a future Moon mission, this water could be used to produce hydrogen and oxygen for propulsion and oxygen for breathable air for the crew. In this set of activities, we are going to investigate how to store energy in batteries and how to generate oxygen and hydrogen from water. In order to do so we need to learn about electrochemistry! Electrochemistry is the branch of science that studies the relationship between electricity and chemistry. Certain chemical reactions can create electricity, as is the case in a battery. The opposite is also possible: electricity can make certain chemical reactions happen that wouldn’t happen spontaneously. In this resource students will be guided through the principles and chronology of electrochemistry, from the invention of the first battery (the voltaic pile) to the modern use of fuel cells.
